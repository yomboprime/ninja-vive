# ninja-vive

WebVR demo where you can destroy things ninja-style. Works with HTC Vive or Razer Hydra.

To use the Razer Hydra you will need to run [this](https://github.com/yomboprime/hydrajoy) little C native app which while running it creates a virtual gamepad accessible from the browser. Only GNU/Linux version (perhaps it can be built for Mac, if you can look into it)
